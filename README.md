# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This project is for the back end of an e-commerce site. To interact with the MySQL database, Sequelize and Express were used to help create 
the database. It demonstrates how the API routes are used to perform CRUD operations.

In this application, we first have to initialize npm. Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize should be installed as well. To connect to the database run
mysql -u root -p and enter password. To seed the file, run npm run seed. Then connect to the server by running npm start.

(Please note: I still don't know Insomnia very well, so you might see some error messages. My immediate goal is to keep learning about it.)
